# [Meliorem](https://ukra174.github.io/Meliorem/landing.html)

**Meliorem** is a place where you can train your coding ability without needing... literally anything!

You don't need an account, you don't need an IDE, or even Python installed on your machine. Everything you need is already here, just in your browser! So open the link and start improving your problem solving abilities right now!

#

The main idea behind developing Meliorem is to have the ability to take chalanges, where your algorithm is not just right or wrong. After implementing your solution you receive not only *PASSED* or *FAILED*, but you will receieve a special **Score**, depending on **how well** your algorithm works on some test chunks of data. The higher the **Score**, the better your algorithm is! This means, there is always space for **improvement**!



## Lessons
 
Having this platform now we also decided it would be a nice place for people to learn something in a little more interactive way, then regular university/college does. The first line of lessons will be about [Linear Algebra](https://ukra174.github.io/Meliorem/problem.html?id=Linear_Algebra/0), as we like it and you can start from a little but can also come to really complicated things.
