# Simple operations with vectors



## Addition/Substraction

The sum or difference of two vectors always results in *another* vector. Each component (`x, y, z...`) of this new vector is obtained by adding or subtracting the corresponding components of the original vectors.



We already have your Vector2 and Vector3 classes, so you will just need to extend them like in the code below. That means you don't need to create a new constructor here, as it already *implemented* in `Vector2`/`Vector3`.


## Code

```python
# Extending classes using inheritance :)
class Vector2(Vector2):
# We will show what you need to do on Vector2, but you must implement everything for both classes!
    def __add__(self,other):
        ...
        # tip: you will need to create new Vector2 instance and put *some* values into it
        # after you have done all the operations needed to shape the result vector just return it like
        #return(resulted_vector)
    # same goes for
    def __sub__(self,other):
        ...
        # do not mess up the minuend and subtrahend here
        # you substract other from self
    
    
# After implementing substraction and addition for those Vectors we will be able to just add or substract them
# as simply, as normal numbers

# Let's create some random vectors we could work with
a = Vector3(0,1,-1)
b = Vector3(1,2,3)
c = a + b

print(c) # (1,3,2)
print(a - c) # (-1,-2,-3) # we got -c! Can you tell why?
    
```


PS: *don't forget `self` argument for class functions!*

## Python stuff

To make it easier to analyse what you're doing, we added `__str__()` method to your vectors. That means you can just use `print()` on any of  Vector2/3 objects and you will receieve it nicely printed like `(0,1,-1)`. Just FYI here is what the function we added to `Vector3` look like:

```python
def __str__(self):
    return(f"({self.x}, {self.y}, {self.z})")
